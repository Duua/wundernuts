# Wundernuts

Wundernut is a coding challenge that we publish few times a year rewarding the winner of it at the end. Made completely by our employees, it’s a brainy puzzle for us each time too! But we like to put our brain into thinking how to activate and challenge fellow coders with a new Wundernut to crack each time!

How did we get the idea of Wundernut in the first place? Read the story behind it: https://medium.com/wunderdog-culture/the-wundernut-story-e9f4a3e321f9
